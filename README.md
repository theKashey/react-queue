To schedule events one-after another. To play _lazy_ animations in order, correlated with their position on the page.

# API
- `Scheduler` - task scheduler. Collect tasks and execute them with `stepDelay` between in the `priority` order.
  - stepDelay - delay between two events
  - source - priority calculation function
  
```js
import {Scheduler} from 'react-queue';

<Scheduler stepDelay={1000} >
{channel => .... }
</Scheduler>

<Scheduler stepDelay={1000} source={ ({ref}) => ref.getBoundingClientRect().top} />
```
`channel` also provides `channel.reset()` function, to clear all `executed` bits, and start everything from the scratch.

- `Queue` - queued event
  - `channel` - channel acquired from Scheduler
  - `callback` - callback to execute. In case of callback will return a number, or a promise resolving to number,
  next tick will be moved by {number}ms. In case of just Promise - next tick will wait to for promise to be resolved.
  - `children` - any DOM node, Queue will pass as `ref` into scheduler's `source` 

```js
import {Scheduler, Queue} from 'react-queue';

<Scheduler stepDelay={1000} >
{channel => 
  <Queue channel={channel} priority={1} callback={doSomething} />
}
</Scheduler>
```
